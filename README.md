# TODO

- [ ] Implement *create* action for automating the creation of a new lab.
- [ ] Support real-time collaborative editing between Emacs and Visual Studio Code.
- [ ] Support other scripting languages (like Lua or Julia)
- [ ] Support flexible Python actions (for running multiple .py files like needed for *oscillations*)
- [ ] Update vscode actions with C
- [ ] Link overleaf

# Introduction

This repository contains all the Physics and Computer Science labs and assignments that I and/or my lab partners performed in the University of Groningen. The labs are:
* Mechanics and Relativity (with Tyn Rendering)
    * oscillations
    * gyroscope
* Electricity and Magnetism (with Maartje Metz)
    * capacitors
* Algorithms and Data Structures in C (with Lucas Chudy)
    * planes    (me)
	* equations (me)
    * lpm       (group)
* Individual Assignments
    * linear-algebra
	* calculus
	* computational-methods-1

Sometimes, I have busy weeks so I don't bother with LaTeX formatting and, therefore, just the images of my assignments are uploaded. Besides, often people use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for LaTeX and, therefore, I copied all the papers we made there here. They may or may not be stored on Overleaf, since I don't plan on maintaining my Overleaf account.

# Installation

For anybody who wants to peek at my assignments (why?), just clone the main branch and checkout to the branch you are interested in. Afterwards, follow [WINDOWS_INSTALL](WINDOWS_INSTALL.md) (assumed for less tech-savvy people) or [LINUX_INSTALL](LINUX_INSTALL.md) (assumed for more tech-savvy people). This setup uses vscode actions and makefile to build labs/assignments. For vscode actions, instructions are in [WINDOWS_INSTALL](WINDOWS_INSTALL.md). For people who knows how to use makefile, follow the docs in the [makefile](makefile).

# Preps

1. zero out electrometer
2. connect the GND
3. wear the ground bracelet

# 1 experiment

GOAL: 12 measurements, 2 samples

the separation 2mm

1. the sphere 1000V, then disconnect from the power => keep large distance
2. touch the rod to the sphere, then to the positive plate
3. note voltage

repeat for 4mm

# 2 experiment

GOAL: 12 measurements, 2 samples

connect the capacitor to 1000V
connect electrometer

1. discharge the Faraday and the rod
2. note position on the plate
3. touch the rod to the plate, then transfer to the cage
4. note the voltage
5. repeat for the same position

# 3 experiment

GOAL: 12 measurements, 2 samples

initial separation 2mm
capacitor charged with 20V
electrometer range 30

1. note the voltage
2. change the separation (up to the max)

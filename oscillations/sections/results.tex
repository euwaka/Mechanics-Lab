The oscillations produced without an added damping factor, i.e. the magnet are displayed in \ref{fig:undamped_oscillations}. The assumption was made that the string to which the springs were attached did not slip from the pulley.

\end{figure}

From the measurements the coordinates of the maxima were determined and from this the natural frequency was determined to be 4.8 +- 0.1 rad/s, which was constant throughout the measurements.

A damping term was added by placing the magnet back in its original position, the oscillations are displayed in \ref{fig:underdamped}. The coordinates of nine of the maxima were determined and were plotted in \ref{fig:log of damping factor}.

The displacement amplitude $x(t)$ decreases with:
\begin{equation}
  x(t) = e^{-\gamma t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) 
  \label{eq:displacement amplitude}
\end{equation}
The slope of the line of best fit $l$ is equal to the $-\gamma$ term in \ref{eq:displacement amplitude}
\begin{equation}
  |l| = \gamma 
\end{equation}
By this a damping factor of $1.3 Â± 0.2$ rad/s was determined.

  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{oscillations/images/resonance}
  \caption{Amplitude and phase difference of the oscillations plotted against driving frequency.}
  \label{fig:resonance}
\end{figure}

The graph of the amplitude and phase difference of the oscillations against driving frequencies with best-fit curves and correspoding uncertanties are depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:resonance}. Tabular data with respective errors are depicted in Table \ref{tab:data}.

Resonance frequency from the amplitude-frequency graph is estimated to be $\omega_{amplitude} = 4.35 \pm 0.09 (rad/s)$. Resonance frequency from the phase-frequency graph is estimated to be $\omega_{phase} = 4.46 \pm 0.02 (rad/s)$. Combined resonance frequency is

\begin{equation*}
\omega_{r} = \frac{\omega_{amplitude} + \omega_{phase}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\sigma(\omega_{amplitude}) + \sigma(\omega_{phase})} = 4.41 \pm 0.09 (rad/s)
\end{equation*}

Damping factor is again evaluated from Eq.~\ref{eq:freq_deps}.

\begin{equation*}
        \gamma = \sqrt{ \frac{\omega^2 - \omega_{res}^2}{2} } = \sqrt{ \frac{4.79^2 - 4.41^2}{2} } = 1.32 \pm 0.8 (rad/s)
\end{equation*}       

This damping factor matches the damping factor previously calculated in a different way.

Error analysis for the resonance frequencies and the damping factor is located in Appendix \ref{appendix:errors}.

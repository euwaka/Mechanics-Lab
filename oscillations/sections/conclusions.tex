The outcome of this experiment was that adding a damping factor to the oscillating system decreased the amplitude of the resonance frequency and shifted its peak to the left.

Future improvements of this experiment would be to perform the experiment of a more stable base such that no superfluous motion would disrupt the oscillatory motion. Another improvement would be to use rotary sensors with smaller interfalls between measurements. Slipping of the strings should be minimized by restricting the angular moting of the springs and strings.

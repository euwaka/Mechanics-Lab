To conclude, experimentally calculated damping factors, resonance frequency, and natural frequency followed the hypothesis. Future improvements of the setup are the performance of the experiment on a more stable base, usage of rotary sensors with a higher time-resolution and more precise measurements of displacements and derivatives. Slipping of the strings should be minimized by restricting the angular motion of the springs and strings.

The main objective of this experiment was to investigate the oscillatory motion of a damped harmonic oscillator that was driven by an electric motor. The experimental setup depicted in Figure 1 consists of an oscillation disc at the top, that is equipped with a rotation sensor to measure the angular displacement. A magnet that adds a damping term is located next to the disc. An electric motor at the bottom of the set up delivers a driving force, above the motor a second rotary motion sensor is located to measure the frequency and phase of the driving force.

Gyroscope is a rotationary mechanical system with two degrees of freedom which is a subject to precession under initial spinning and an application of an external torque. In this experiment, precession period was calculated for multiple initial settings using the spinning period, and measured directly using precession frequency data from the sensor. Linear relation between the external torque and precession period was tested and verified by the slope $T_{p_\text{calculated}} / T_{p_\text{measured}} = 1.0 \pm 0.2$. Lastly, this lab report presents emperical evidence for $\boldsymbol\tau = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}$ as it is the research question, and explains real-world phenomena based on the conservation of angular momentum in the absence of a net external torque.
